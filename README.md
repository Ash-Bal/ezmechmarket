# mechmarket

## Background:

ez-mechmarket is a website that makes browsing through r/mechmarket a more enjoyable experience. r/mechmarket is a subreddit that functions as a market for the mechanical keyboard community. People can by and sell mechanical keyboards and all the components involved, and members can advertise future group buys. 

## Motivation:

My website takes new posts from users that are selling parts, and displays the images associated with the post. This creates a better user experience and makes the mechmarket more accessible for newer members of the community that may not know all the parts by their names. 

## Functionality:

 - Each post in mechmarket gets its own image carousel
 - Posts with multiple images can be flipped through easily
 - Post titles are shortened, displayed, and link to the original reddit post 
 - Images scale within their box and the whole image will always be displayed
 - Making the screen skinnier changes the format of the grid for better formatting
 
 
 ## To-Do:
 
  - deploy using cloud service
  - expand post title when hovering over link
  - add scrolling banner at the top with favorite images
  - add database functionality that purges posts after certain amount of time
